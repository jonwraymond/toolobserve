# toolobserve

> **DEPRECATED**: This package has been moved to [`github.com/jonwraymond/toolops/observe`](https://github.com/jonwraymond/toolops/tree/main/observe).
>
> This repository is no longer maintained. Please migrate to the new location.

## Migration

See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for migration instructions.

## Why the Move?

The `toolobserve` functionality has been consolidated into the `toolops` repository as the `observe` package. This consolidation:

- Reduces the number of repositories to manage
- Provides better cohesion between observability and operational tooling
- Simplifies dependency management across the stack

## Timeline

- **Now**: Both packages are available; `toolobserve` forwards to `toolops/observe`
- **Next minor release**: `toolobserve` will be archived
- **Future**: No further updates to this repository

## Original Documentation

For reference, the original documentation has been preserved in the `docs/` directory.
